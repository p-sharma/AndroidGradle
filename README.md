# androidgradle

Skeleton android project with default gradle settings for

* Jacoco
* Checkstyle
* Lint check
* Custom maven repository
* Signing config

Idea here is to keep on modularizing and updating gradle build script so that there is an "ideal" android app build script in hand. 
Most of the snippets i have learned from my work and stackoverflow. 


TODO :

1. Externalize each feature in separate gradle file, so that they can be included externally. 
2. Add support for product flavors and build variants.
